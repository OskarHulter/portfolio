            My passion for computers started at the age of six. Specifically,
            around the time my step-father had to write a note, explaining the
            steps to launch Warcraft 2 from MS-DOS. For me, that note was a
            portal to another world.
            <br />
            A world which I embraced.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>
                A lot has changed since those days, but my passion remained.
            </strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            After a time of pursuing other passions, traveling and working
            day-jobs I finally realized my true calling had been there all
            along. In hindsight it's so obvious, but that realization was one of
            the greatest releifs of my life.
            <br />

            I finished my bachelor's degree in Systems Science at Lule√• Tekniska
            Universitet, 2018. My thesis focused on improving software
            documentation using data visualization. Since then I've focused my
            atention on modern web development. Long term I would love to learn
            more about machine learning.

            I enjoy working across the stack and always try to choose the right
            tool for the job. Design patterns, testing, software architecture &
            declarative/functional programming are the areas I am most excited
            about at the moment.
            <br />
            The art of writing clean code that is consistent, consise, elegant
            and readable is a fulfulling challenge that I try to get better at
            each day.
            <br />
            The methodologies I embrace in my private work are Agile, Lean
            Software Development & Kanban.
            <br />
            My favorite JS tools are react, redux, webpack, styled-components &
            gatsby.
            <br />
            Other programming languages that I have previous experience with are
            C, C#, Java & php.

            technical topics include modern javascript, testing, functional &
