            <TextTitle>My Story</TextTitle>
            My passion for computers started at the age of six. Specifically,
            around the time my step-father had to write a note, explaining the
            steps to launch Warcraft 2 from MS-DOS.
            <br />
            <br />
            A lot has changed since those days, but my passion remained.
            <br />
            <br />
            After a time of pursuing other passions I realized my true calling.
            I finished my degree in Systems Science at Lule√• Tekniska
            Universitet, 2018. Since then I've focused my atention on modern web
            development.

            Today I focus on modern web development, specializing in JavaScript.
            I enjoy working across the stack and always try to choose the right
            tool for the job. That said, I do have a few favorites. I have
            previous experience of C, C# Java & php. Methodologies & Best
            practices: Agile LEAN Kanban Mobile-first Bachelor's in Systems
            Science (LTU, 2018).

            Other great passions are music, strategy games & hiking. My favorite
            technical topics include modern javascript, testing, functional &
            declarative programmering.
