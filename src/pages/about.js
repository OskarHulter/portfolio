            <TextTitle>My Story</TextTitle>
            My passion for computers started at the age of six. Specifically,
            around the time my step-father had to write a note, explaining the
            steps to launch Warcraft 2 from MS-DOS. For me, that note was a
            portal to another world.
            <br />
            A world which I embraced.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>
                A lot has changed since those days, but my passion remained.
            </strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            After a time of pursuing other passions, traveling and working
            day-jobs I finally realized my true calling had been there all
            along. In hindsight it's so obvious, but that realization was one of
            the greatest releifs of my life.
            <br />
            <br />
            I finished my bachelor's degree in Systems Science at Lule√• Tekniska
            Universitet, 2018. My thesis focused on improving software
            documentation using data visualization. Since then I've focused my
            atention on modern web development. Long term I would love to learn
            more about machine learning.

            ecosystem.

            <br />
            I enjoy working across the stack and always try to choose the right
            tool for the job. Design patterns, testing, software architecture &
            declarative/functional programming are the areas I am most excited
            about at the moment.
            <br />
            The art of writing clean code that is consistent, consise, elegant
            and readable is a fulfulling challenge that I try to get better at
            each day.
            <br />
            Besides programming I really enjoy doing design and UX work as well.
            I don't mind database management, but in a lot of cases it makes
            sense to delegate that to some third party. This allows me to focus
            on delivering an awesome user experience. The methodologies I
            embrace in my private work are Agile, Lean Software Development &
            Kanban.
            <br />
            My favorite JS tools are react, redux, webpack, styled-components &
            gatsby.
            <br />
            Other programming languages that I have previous experience with are
            C, C#, Java & php.

            <TextTitle>My Personality</TextTitle>
            My nature is very analytical, which is reflected in my three biggest
            interests: music, strategy games & programming.
            <br />
            As with any personaliy trait; an analytical mindset brings both
            opportunities and challenges. It means that I really enjoy the
            process of programming, working on my craft, experiencing new
            realizations and the fulfillment of solving problems efficiently. I
            am always looking for another angle, to find new insights. The
            challenge is that I am susceptible to analysis paralysis if the most
            efficient solution is unclear. I try to remedy this by acknowledging
            that no solution has to be perfect from the start, and that even if
            you start building something that isn't the most efficinet solution,
            you can still learn more about what you need than if you sit around
            and think. Even though I am an introvert, I am still very talkative
            and enjoy working with other people, especially when we are learning
            together. To me, life is one big learning experience and it is more
            fulfulling to share it. One of my core values is to always leave my
            ego at the door and take every opportunity to improve. This means
            that I really enjoy getting feedback from others, even if it could
            be construed as critizism. Other great passions are music, strategy
            games & hiking. I really believe in the power of expanding your
            comfort-zone by taking on challanges that forces you to grow. My
            favorite technical topics include modern javascript, testing,
            functional & declarative programmering. I love customizing my
            development experience to improve my productivity. I use VS code
            which has a great selection of extensions, my absolute favorite
            being VIM.
