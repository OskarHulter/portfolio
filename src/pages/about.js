            <TextTitle>My Story</TextTitle>
            My passion for computers started at the age of six. Specifically,
            around the time my step-father had to write a note, explaining the
            steps to launch Warcraft 2 from MS-DOS. For me, that note was a
            portal to another world.
            <br />
            A world which I embraced.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>
                A lot has changed since those days, but my passion remained.
            </strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            After a time of pursuing other passions, studying, traveling and
            working day-jobs I finally realized my true calling had been there
            all along.
            <br />
            <br />
            I finished my bachelor's degree in Systems Science at Lule√• Tekniska
            Universitet, 2018. My thesis focused on improving software
            documentation using data visualization. Since then I've focused my
            atention on modern web development. Long term I would love to learn
            more about machine learning.

            Specialized in semantic HTML, modern CSS, JavaScript ES20xx & its
            ecosystem.

            I enjoy the whole stack and always try to choose the right tool for
            the job. Design patterns, testing, software architecture &
            declarative/functional programming are the areas I am most excited
            about at the moment.
            <br />
            The art of writing clean code that is consistent, consise, elegant
            and readable is a fulfulling challenge that I try to get better at
            each day.
            <br />
            I really enjoy doing design and UX work as well. I don't mind
            database management, but delegating that responsibility to a third
            party allows me to focus on delivering an awesome user experience.
            The methodologies I embrace in my work are Agile, Lean Software
            Development & Kanban.
            <br />
            My favorite JS tools are react, redux, webpack, styled-components &
            gatsby.
            <br />
            Other programming languages that I have previous experience with are
            C, C#, Java & php.

            <TextTitle>My Personality</TextTitle>
            I have a very analytical mindset. This is reflected in my three
            biggest interests: music, strategy games & programming.
            <br />
            <br />
            As with any personaliy trait, an analytical mindset brings both
            opportunities and challenges. I really enjoy the process of
            learning, working on my craft, experiencing new realizations and the
            fulfillment of solving problems efficiently. I am always looking for
            another angle, to find new insights.
            <br />
            <br />
            The challenge is that I am susceptible to analysis paralysis. I try
            to remedy this by acknowledging that no solution has to be perfect
            from the start. Even if you start building something that isn't the
            most efficient solution, you can still learn more about what you
            need than if you just sit around and think.
            <br />
            <br />
            Even though I am an introvert, I am still very talkative and enjoy
            working with other people, especially when we are learning together.
            One of my core values is to always leave my ego at the door and take
            every opportunity to improve. This means that I really enjoy getting
            feedback from others, even if it could be construed as critizism.
            <br />
            <br />
            I love customizing my development experience to improve my
            productivity. I use VS code which has a great selection of
            extensions, my absolute favorite being VIM.
