            <TextTitle>My Story</TextTitle>
            My passion for computers started at the age of six.
            <br />
            Specifically, around the time my step-father wrote a note, <br />
            explaining the steps to launch Warcraft 2 from MS-DOS.
            <br />
            That note became a portal to another world.
            <br />A world which I embraced.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>
                A lot has changed since 1997, but my passion remained.
            </strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            After a time of pursuing other interests, studying, traveling and
            working day-jobs I finally realized that my true calling had been
            there all along.
            <br />I finished my bachelor's degree in Systems Science at Lule√•
            Tekniska Universitet, 2018. My thesis was an exploratory case-study
            about improving software documentation using data visualization.
            <br />
            Since then I've focused my attention on modern web development.

        </SkillText>
        <TextContent>
            Specialized in semantic HTML, modern CSS, JavaScript ES20xx & its
            ecosystem. I enjoy the whole stack and always try to choose the
            right tool for the job. Design patterns, testing, software
            architecture & declarative/functional programming are the areas I am
            most excited about at the moment.
            <br />
            The art of writing clean code that is consistent, consise, elegant
            and readable is a fulfulling challenge that I try to get better at
            each day.
            <br />
            <br />I enjoy doing design and UX work because I'm motivated by
            impacting the end-users in a direct way. I don't mind database
            management, but delegating that responsibility to a third party
            allows me to focus on delivering an awesome user experience. The
            methodologies I embrace in my work are Agile, Lean Software
            Development & Kanban.
            <br />
            <br />
            My favorite JS tools are react, redux, webpack, styled-components &
            gatsby.
            <br />
            Other programming languages that I have previous experience with are
            C, C#, Java & php. Long term I would love to learn more about
            machine learning.

            <TextTitle>My Personality</TextTitle>I definitely have an analytical
            mindset. This is reflected in my three biggest interests: music,
            strategy games & programming.
            <br />
            <br />
            As with any personality trait, an analytical mindset brings both
            opportunities and challenges. I really enjoy the process of
            learning, working on my craft, experiencing new realizations and the
            fulfillment of solving problems efficiently. I am always looking for
            another angle, to find new insights.
            <br />
            <br />
            My primary challenge is that I am susceptible to analysis paralysis.
            I try to remedy this by acknowledging that no solution has to be
            perfect from the start. Even if you start building something that
            isn't the most efficient solution, you'll still learn more about
            what's needed than if you sit around and think.
            <br />
            <br />I enjoy working with other people & I am very talkative for
            being an introvert. One of my core values is to always leave my ego
            at the door and take every opportunity to improve. This means that I
            value feedback from others, even if it could be construed as
            criticism.
            <br />
            <br />
            Currently I am developing a website called stressless.productions
            that will host royalty-free music. It is still under construction
            but I will post more info when I've come a bit further along. I am
            also in the process of creating a webshop called festivaltent.shop
            offering tents with fun patterns.
